## Security

- API keys are encrypted using Electron's [safeStorage](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/safe-storage) (OS-native encryption)
- Security fuses enabled to prevent common Electron vulnerabilities
- Context isolation and disabled Node integration in renderer
- **Domain-restricted networking**: Outgoing requests are limited to `*.turbopuffer.com` only

### Network Security Note

This application disables Chromium's web security (CORS) to allow the Turbopuffer SDK to communicate with the API from the renderer process. To mitigate the associated risks, all outgoing network requests are filtered and restricted to:

- `*.turbopuffer.com` (Turbopuffer API)
- `api.github.com/repos/MrPeker/turbopuffer-gui/*` (update checks, from main process only)
- `localhost` / `127.0.0.1` (development only)
- Local files (`file://`)

Any request to other domains is blocked. This prevents potential data exfiltration even if a malicious script were to run in the renderer.

**Future Improvement**: API requests should be migrated from the renderer process to the main process via IPC. This would eliminate the need to disable web security and provide better isolation between the UI and network layer.

For security vulnerabilities, please see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
